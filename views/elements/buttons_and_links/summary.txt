elements / notes
  links - preferred over buttons because they do not submit forms
    style options
      link
      button
      icon
    variations
      ajax
      no-href
      modal (no href + data-target + modal wrapper after button)
  buttons - only used when needing to submit button via icon (because inputs type="submit" do not work well with icon styling)
    style options
      [button - this should not be used]
      [link - this should not be used]
      icon- used to submit forms
  inputs type="submit"
    style options
      button
      link
      image
      NOTE: does not work well with icon styles
  other button / link types
    ses edit button (this is a no-href link so payattention)
      styles options
        button
        icon
        link
      variations
        modal
    group ses cancel and submit buttons (this one does not have style options and variations, but rather just options that you can customize as needed if needed)
      options
        button
        icon
        modal - very similiar to the "button" opion but this one uses justify-contents-around (instead of justify-content-end) and closes modal on cancel (as well as performs cancelEdit function) (this needs to be tested...)
        [link style is basically never used so not creating template or mapping for it... but it could easily be done manually]
    group to close modal - there is just one base example and variations can be made from there
