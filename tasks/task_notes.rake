      # DeleteThis - do not combine sub-tasks into one single task if they can be split up. If 2 sub-tasks that could be separate are bundled into a single task, and the first subtask fails (ex. "send email to admin"), then the second task will not be run (ex. "send email to user")
      # DeleteThis - For cron jobs, be very cognizant of the task size. If it's a large, expensive task, then push task to background job and simply use cron job to call background job
      # DeleteThis - NOTE:  the :environment" dependency allows items from your environment (such as models, reocords, other?, etc.). A dependency in rake tasks is simply just another rake task that will be called before the defined task is run. So this would cause the :environment task to be run before the task you are defining.
